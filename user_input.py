# User input

# Prompt the user to enter their name 
# name = input("Please enter your name: ")

# Print the greeting message
#print("Hello " + name + "! Nice to meet you!")


# Print the greeting message with f-string
#print(f"Hello, {name}! Nice to meet you!")

# Putting it all together:
# write a script that asks the user for their name and then prints a greeting message with their name.
