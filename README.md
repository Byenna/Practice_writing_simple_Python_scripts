# Practice_writing_simple_Python_scripts
A few hands-on Scripts to help you practice writing simple Python scripts

**Check the README.md of the specific branch for guidance**

Script 1: User Input
Write a script that asks the user to enter their name and then prints a greeting message with their name.

Script 2: Temperature Conversion
Write a script that asks the user to enter a temperature in Celsius and converts it to Fahrenheit. The conversion formula is: F = (C * 9/5) + 32, where F is the temperature in Fahrenheit and C is the temperature in Celsius.

Script 3: Even or Odd
Write a script that asks the user to enter an integer and then determines whether the number is even or odd. Print an appropriate message to the console.

Script 4: Sum of Numbers
Write a script that asks the user to enter a series of numbers (separated by commas) and calculates the sum of those numbers. Print the sum to the console.

Script 5: Reverse a String
Write a script that asks the user to enter a string and then prints the reverse of that string.

Script 6: Factorial
Write a script that asks the user to enter an integer and calculates its factorial. The factorial of a non-negative integer n is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n. Print the factorial to the console.

Script 7: Fibonacci Sequence
Write a script that asks the user to enter the number of terms they want in the Fibonacci sequence and then prints the sequence. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. The sequence starts with 0 and 1.

Script 8: Prime Numbers
Write a script that asks the user to enter an integer and determines whether it is a prime number. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that is divisible only by 1 and itself. Print an appropriate message to the console.

Script 9: File Reader
Write a script that reads a text file (you can create a sample text file with some content) and prints its contents to the console.
